            <h1>Progestogens</h1>
            <p>This class of hormones has a somewhat nebulous intended usage in feminizing hormone therapy. There are many anecdotal usages, e.g. breast enlargement or additional feminization, but none in transgender women that have been studied systematically.</p>
            <p>There are various chemicals under the name of progestogens, however what I'll be talking about in this article is progesterone; this hormone can strongly inhibit sex-hormone production, which is also why some people use them in feminizing hormone therapy. This may also be used, topically, in treating androgen-dependent conditions of the skin and hair, like oily skin or scalp hair loss. This is because progesterone can actually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432488/">reduce levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) locally when applied topically.</a></p>
