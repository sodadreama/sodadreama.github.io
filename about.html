            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>My name is Gray (she/they) and I made this website to try to clear up some confusion that people new to DIYing HRT will inevitably face, especially when looking for appropriate dosages and what certain medications are and what they do specifically, in the context of medical transition. During the beginning stages of my transition, I definitely would have found it helpful to have a sort of pokedex of different medications and their interactions, side effects, caveats, etc. and maybe even some ways to make them. Hence the creation of this website. My socials are mainly Discord (fishinthepool#6461) and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fish1nth3pool">Reddit</a>.</p>
