            <h1>Estrogens</h1>
            <p>This hormone (specifically a sex steroid) is the most common medication used in feminizing hormone therapy. .</p>
            <p>There are various forms of this hormone; the main three are estradiol, estrone, and estriol, and these have affinities to estrogen receptors in cells, and the main ones are the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). Estrogen derivatives that have selective estrogen receptor affinities dependent on the tissue they are in are called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)</p>
            <p>These chemicals have various effects. The most obvious ones are feminization, e.g. gynoid fat distribution, breast development, and the softening of the skin, however, there are other less obvious effects—these are because sex steroids actually modulate gene expression, e.g. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3975301/">a change in the regulation of protein expression and signaling pathways in the heart.</a></p>
            <p>Estradiol, specifically, is the main chemical administered in feminizing hormone therapy, and it has various routes of administration, which are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subcutaneous</li>
                <li>Intramuscular</li>
                <li>Transdermal</li>
                <li>Oral</li>
                <li>Sublingual/buccal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In all routes of administration except for transdermal, estradiol is typically used in forms that have <a href="">esters</a> attached to them which make the metabolism of it more of a slow-burn process (a few days) instead of something done within the matter of hours. The most extreme of these esters is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecylic_acid">undecanoic acid</a>, which can make a sex steroid take up to a month to fully break down.</p>
            <p>Like any exogenous substance, estrogens can have some negative side effects such as: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341440/">Increased risk of thrombosis</a>; this often occurs within the first few months of usage.</li>
                <li>Increased risk of breast cancer</li>
                <li>Liver failure (in the case of oral medications)</li>
            </ul>
