            <h1>Estrogens</h1>
            <h2>Summary</h2><br>
            <p>Use estradiol specifically if you want the most feminizing effects in your hormone regimen. Intramuscular/subcutaneous administration is the most common with monotherapy, however use scrotal transdermal application if you wish. Oral medications can strain your liver, so be careful and take regular blood tests if you can. Thrombosis often occurs within the first few months of starting hormone therapy, so watch out for that.
            <br>
            The common starting dosages are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Oral estradiol: 4 mg/day</li>
                <li>Sublingual/buccal estradiol: 1-2 mg/day</li>
                <li>Transdermal gel: 3mg/day (this can be much lower when applied scrotally)</li>
                <li>Intramuscular or subcutaneous injection: 2mg/week</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            
            
            

            <h2>What are estrogens?</h2>
            <p>This class of hormones (specifically sex hormones) are the most common used in feminizing hormone therapy.</p>
            <p>The main three forms are estradiol, estrone, and estriol, and these have affinities to estrogen receptors in cells, and the main ones are the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). Estrogen derivatives that have selective estrogen receptor affinities dependent on the tissue they are in are called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)</p>
            <p>These chemicals have various effects, which may be called feminizing effects. The most obvious ones are gynoid fat distribution, breast development, and the softening of the skin, however, there are other less obvious effects—these are because sex steroids actually modulate gene expression, e.g. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3975301/">a change in the regulation of protein expression and signaling pathways in the heart.</a></p>
            <p>Estradiol, specifically, is the main chemical administered in feminizing hormone therapy, and it has various routes of administration, which are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="estrogen-basic.html#im-subq-estradiol">Subcutaneous</a></li>
                <li><a href="estrogen-basic.html#im-subq-estradiol">Intramuscular</a></li>
                <li><a href="estrogen-basic.html#td-estradiol">Transdermal</a></li>
                <li>Oral</li>
                <li>Sublingual/buccal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In all routes of administration except for transdermal, estradiol is typically used in forms that have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_estrogen_esters">esters</a> attached to them which make the metabolism of it more of a slow-burn process (a few days) instead of something done within the matter of hours. The most extreme of these esters is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecylic_acid">undecanoic acid</a>, which can make a sex steroid take up to a month to fully break down.</p>
            <p>Like any exogenous substance, estrogens can have some negative side effects such as: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7341440/">Increased risk of thrombosis</a>; this can often occur within the first few months of usage.</li>
                <li>Increased risk of breast cancer</li>
                <li>Liver failure (in the case of oral medications)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Moreover, it can have some interactions with other medications, the main one is levothyroxine, which is used in the treatment of thyroid cancer. Be sure to check with a medical professional before taking estradiol with levothyroxine. Another one is amoxicillin, which is an antibiotic, this can reduce the strength of estradiol when taken orally, so be careful of that.</p>

            <h3><a name="im-subq-estradiol">Intramuscular/Subcutaneous Estradiol</a></h3>
            <p>This is a form of medication that often takes the form of powdered estradiol suspended in an oil, e.g. mct oil, coconut oil, etc. along with other ingredients such as benzyl alcohol which may act as a preservative of the product. It is then injected either into the muscle (Intramuscular) or into fat deposits (Subcutaneous).</p>
            <p>Typical dosages are 2mg/week in the case of monotherapy, which is the recommended method when injecting estradiol. There are various forms of this, like: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Estradiol Valerate</li>
                <li>Estradiol Cypionate</li>
                <li>Estradiol Benzoate</li>
                <li>Estradiol Undecylate</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pros:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Convenience: Only need to administer once every few days instead of every day or every 12 hours like some other routes of administration.</li>
                <li>Blood levels: Estrogen levels in blood are often stable with injected estradiol.</li>
                <li>Price: Cheap to make, a vial lasts a while.</li>
                <li>Effects on liver: This route of administration bypasses the first-pass effect, which reduces strain on the liver, thereby decreasing the chances of liver failure ever happening.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cons:</p> 
                <li>Needles: If the user is afraid of needles, this can impair their abilities to actually administer the hormone. This can be circumvented by having someone else administer the hormone in some cases.</li>
                <li>Blood levels: When a routine is established, estrogen levels within the blood often drop right before the hormone is usually administered. This can cause changes in mood and behavior.</li>
                <li>Sterility and cleanliness: If the manufacturer created a substandard product, the estradiol may not be sterile or clean (risks of heavy metals in the solution) and this can cause conditions such as septic shock and other infections.</li>
            <br>
            <h3><a name="td-estradiol">Transdermal Estradiol</a></h3>
            <p>This route of administration involves the application of estradiol topically (namely, on the skin) where it then disperses throughout your body through that point. The amount of estradiol that reaches your system and in what interval varies by the location you actually apply the estradiol to. For example, <a href="https://transfemscience.org/articles/genital-e2-application/">scrotal application</a> gives the most absorption, whereas a place like the outer thighs may not.</p>
            <p>It is also important to be careful; since you would apply the estradiol to your skin in this case, it can transfer to another person if you make contact with them. One such occurrence is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23426834/">precocious puberty started in an 18-month old boy</a> because of secondary exposure to a transdermal medication with the same absorption mechanism as transdermal estradiol.</p>
            <p>Specifically, this class of transdermal estradiol is the most potent one, because it uses ethyl alcohol/ethanol as an absorption enhancer (a concentration of ~60% ethyl alcohol is the most effective). Typically, it is a solution that has a consistency similar to hand sanitizer, and it is applied to the skin where it evaporates and is absorbed into your skin. Typically, one would have a dose of 2-3mg when applied scrotally, which is the most efficient area when dealing with transdermal estradiol. Other areas would require more.</p>
            <p>One may do <a href="#">monotherapy</a> with this route of administration, or pair this with an anti-androgen.</p>
            <p>Now for the pros: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cheap to produce: It can cost under 5 dollars to make a ~75g vial of estradiol which can last for a month.</li>
                <li>Sterility and cleanliness: Your manufacturing conditions don't have to be perfectly clean, since your skin will filter out the unclean things anyway.</li>
                <li>Impact on liver: This route of administration bypasses the first-pass effect, also leading to a higher bioavailability.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And the cons: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inconvenience: You'll need to apply this once or twice every day, and then you'll need to wait for it to dry off.</li>
                <li>Risk of transference: If you live with anyone who maybe shouldn't be coming into contact with estrogen, you'll need to practice caution when cleaning yourself off after applying the medication.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h3><a name="oral-estradiol">Oral Estradiol</a></h3>
            <p>This is the most common form of estradiol. You have pills and then you swallow them, not much else to it. Unfortunately, however, there are caveats, e.g. its impact on the liver and the low absorption levels from oral estradiol.</p>
            <p>Specifically, whenever you take an oral medication, it passes through the digestive system and then the hepatic portal system, where it's processed by the liver and metabolized. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect">first-pass effect</a>, and it greatly reduces the bioavailability of the drug.</p>
            <p>Usually when doing oral estradiol, one would use an anti-androgen in tandem, something like bicalutamide or spironolactone. Doing monotherapy with oral estradiol would have too much of an impact on the liver to be worth it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Pros:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Convenience: You can just pop the medication in your mouth and be done with it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low bioavailability: You just won't get much estradiol in your system compared to other routes of administration.</li>
                <li>Impact on liver: The first-pass effect that oral estradiol goes through can harm the liver and lead to liver failure in some severe cases.</li>
            </ul>
